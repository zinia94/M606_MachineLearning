## Dataset

Heart Disease Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data

## Introduction

Heart disease is a very serious problem for people of all ages. Nowadays, almost everyone is at risk of heart disease, and the problem is more acute in elderly people. With the help of machine learning and appropriate datasets, it is possible to predict whether a patient has heart disease. I have evaluated seven machine learning classifiers for this purpose and selected the best possible model for this dataset. Future improvements may include adding more data, tuning more hyperparameters, and thoroughly analyzing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Business Problem Definition

I work for ABC Company. With the rapid advancements in technology, our goal is to deliver patient care directly to their homes, eliminating the need for hospital visits. We aim to diagnose symptoms using our machine learning models and predict whether patients have certain diseases.

Specifically, I have been tasked with developing a machine learning pipeline to predict the presence of heart disease in patients. This involves formulating a classification task, where I will design a supervised machine learning pipeline to address this challenge.

## Final Result

We have evaluated our dataset using 7 classifiers:

- Decision Tree
- SVM
- KNN
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

After tuning and evaluating all the models for our dataset, we found that **KNN** achieved the highest accuracy score of **88%** 

This model represents a significant step towards improving diagnostic accuracy and patient care. We aim to continue refining the model, exploring better ways to handle data and incorporating more information to enhance its real-world applicability. By doing so, we strive to make a positive impact on healthcare and further improve patient outcomes.
